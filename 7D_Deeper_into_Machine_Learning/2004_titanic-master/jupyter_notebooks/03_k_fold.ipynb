    "# Kaggle Titanic survival - K-fold stratification\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous example* using logistic regression to classify passengers as likely to survive the Titanic, we used a random split for training and test data. But doing a single assessment like this may lead to an inaccurate assesment of the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use repeated random splits, but a more robust method is to use ‘stratified k-fold validation’. In this method the model is repeated k times, so that all the data is used once, but only once, as part of the test set. This, alone, is k-fold validation. Stratified k-fold validation adds an extra level of robustness by ensuring that in each of the k training/test splits, the balance of outcomes represents the balance of outcomes (between survivors and non-survivors)in the overall data set. Most commonly 5 or 10 different splits of the data are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a full project it is common to also have some hold-back test data that is used only at the end of model development (with k-fold validation used during model development).\n",
    "\n",
    "*https://github.com/MichaelAllen1966/1804_python_healthcare/blob/master/titanic/02_logistic_regression.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "*In this notebook we assume that you have run through the basic logistic regression example in the previous example. We will not explain all steps fully*."
